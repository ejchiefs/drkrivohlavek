Biography:

Cheryl grew up in Laurel, where she met her husband, Kevin. Their two children, Christen and Eric, are both married and live in Ohio and Texas, respectively. That distance puts Cherylâ€™s four grandchildren almost 1000 miles away but at fun places to visit.

At our front office since 1981, Cheryl has been our office manager since 1999. In her spare time, she enjoys sailing, cycling, snorkeling and playing with their puppy, Cooper. She and her husband like to travel, sometimes on their motorcycle.
