Title: Athletic Mouthguards

----

Text: Mouthguards are especially important if you participate in organized sports or other recreational activities. A mouthguard helps to cushion a blow to the face, minimizing the risk of broken teeth and injuries to your lips, tongue, face or jaw. They typically cover the upper teeth and are a great way to protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and cheeks.
