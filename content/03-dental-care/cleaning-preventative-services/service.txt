Title: Cleaning and Preventative Services

Text: Regular checkups and cleanings (twice a year) give you the best chance at enjoying a strong, healthy, and vibrant smile for life. The dentists will evaluate your teeth and gums to find existing or potential problems. Each exam includes an oral cancer screening and patient education. By addressing any issues in the earliest stages, your treatment can be conservative, which means minimal time at the dentist’s office and minimal expense.
