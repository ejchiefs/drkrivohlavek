Title: Emergency Treatment

----

Text: Dental problems don't always happen during regularly scheduled office hours. We offer emergency dental services to address dental issues and help you in any way possible.  We'll do our best to get you in quickly so that we can take care of your problem! For after-hours dental emergencies, please call (402) 992-5943.

Remember: life-threatening reactions to medications, difficulty breathing or serious facial trauma should be treated in an emergency room prior to any treatment by your general dentist.
