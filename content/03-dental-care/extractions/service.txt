Title: Extractions (Primary and Permanent Teeth) 

----

Text: Occasionally, a primary or baby tooth may not become loose on its own and may block the eruption of its permanent replacement tooth. At your orthodontist's request or your general dentist's diagnosis, primary and/or permanent teeth may be removed in our office to allow for an improved orthodontic result.
In some cases, removal of a permanent tooth is the best treatment option or the alternative treatment option that is chosen. If appropriate, we remove some permanent teeth in our office. Our patients' comfort and safety are always a top priority. Through the use of x-rays and a clinical exam, we will determine if the tooth can be removed in our office or if referral to an oral surgeon is needed. We will gladly send any x-rays from your visit to the oral surgeon you choose.
