Title: Implant Restorations

----

Text: Implants are used to replace single or multiple teeth and to help stabilize dentures. An oral surgeon places the implants, and then we "restore" your teeth to maximum strength, durability and esthetics, using crowns or dentures. You can find out if this is a viable option for you during a consultation appointment.
