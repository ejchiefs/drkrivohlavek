Title: Intra-Oral Camera

----

Text: A small camera wand is placed in the mouth and the live image is magnified and displayed on the treatment room computer screen. This image allows us to capture snapshots of your mouth and show you parts of your mouth that you don't normally see. It is much easier to understand and discuss your oral condition and any treatment options that are presented when you can see them.
