Title: Orthodontic Evaluations

----

Text: Crooked or crowded teeth make cleaning your teeth difficult, which can lead to decay, gum disease, and tooth loss. Orthodontic problems can also play a part in abnormal wear of teeth, excessive stress on gums and supporting tissues, or misalignment of the jaw joints. While we don’t offer orthodontic treatment at our office, we will gladly refer you to an orthodontist in the area, and we will work hand in hand with that doctor to provide you the most comprehensive dental care.
