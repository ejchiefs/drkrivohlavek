Title: Periodontal Treatment for Gum Disease

----

Text: Gum disease is the single most prevalent disease in America. It affects more people than heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, and cancer combined, and about 80% of the population has some form of gum disease. Because healthy gums are crucial for healthy teeth, we'll evaluate the state of your gums during routine checkups and determine an appropriate plan of action if necessary. This plan may include simply changing your brushing technique, deep cleaning treatments at our office, or in severe cases, referral to a periodontist.
