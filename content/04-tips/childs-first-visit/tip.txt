Title: Your Child's First Visit

----

Text:

* Familiarize your child with the dentist and dental office by taking him or her along with you or a friend. Let your dentist know in advance to allow time to get acquainted.

* Be low key about the visit. Your child has no reason to be afraid unless fear is suggested.

* Take cues from the dentist, who's experienced at dealing with children, and don't expect perfect behavior from your child.
