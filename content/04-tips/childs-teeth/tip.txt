Title: Taking Care of Your Child's Teeth

###How can I teach my child proper dental care?
* Imitation is the best way to teach your child how to brush and floss. Children as young as two or three can learn to brush by watching you, although you should follow up with a thorough brushing.
* Get your child into the habit of brushing at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. Parents should also floss their toddler's teeth. By the age of 10, children should be able to floss by themselves.
* Most of all, be sure to praise your child for clean teeth, a nice smile, and good dental health habits!

###How can we help avoid cavities?
* Of all age groups, children are the most cavity prone. It's critical that they brush twice a day and floss daily to remove plaque, the colorless film of bacteria that forms on teeth and leads to decay and gum disease.
* A well-balanced diet and limited snacking also promote good oral health.
* Fluoride makes teeth stronger and more resistant to decay. Drinking fluoridated water from birth can reduce cavities substantially. Fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses provide important protection, too.
* And remember: regular dental checkups are key to healthy oral development!
