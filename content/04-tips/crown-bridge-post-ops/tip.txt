Title: Crown and Bridge Post-Operative Instructions

----

Text:

The following steps are very important for your comfort and the ultimate success of the procedure:

1. Do NOT eat or drink for 1 hour after your procedure.

2. A TEMPORARY covering has been placed with TEMPORARY cement, so do NOT eat anything hard or sticky in this area. If you feel this covering come loose, call immediately so that it can be replaced. It is important that the temporary stays securely in place until the final appointment.

3. The procedure today involved gum tissue. If this area is sensitive, place a 1/2 teaspoonful of table salt in an eight-ounce glass of warm water and rinse this area two-three times a day until it is comfortable.

4. This area MAY be sensitive to temperature changes for a short period of time. This will go away.

5. Remember that this is a TEMPORARY. This covering is only meant to protect the area until the real crown or bridge is completed.

6. If you have any questions before your final appointment, PLEASE CALL.
