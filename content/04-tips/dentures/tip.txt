Title: You and Your Dentures

It will take time to get used to your new denture(s). Be patient. Here are some helpful tips for this adjustment period:

###Eating
Begin by eating small bites of soft foods and chew slowly. Gradually advance to larger bites and harder foods.

###Care and Cleaning
It's very important to keep your denture and your natural teeth as clean as possible. After eating, rinse your denture under the faucet to remove food debris. For daily, thorough cleaning, use a denture brush to clean the denture.
In the evening, place your denture in the provided cup with a cleansing tablet and enough water to cover the denture. When cleaning or rinsing your denture, always do so over a sink with water in the bottom to prevent breakage if accidentally dropped. Always remove your denture at night before bed. This allows the teeth and gum tissues to rest and blood to circulate to these areas.

###Insertion and Removal
Always insert and remove your denture, with your hands. NEVER put a partial denture in your mouth and bite it into place. You may cause damage to other teeth if it is not properly positioned.

###Adjustments
Your new denture should be comfortable and functional. If you have any problems, call immediately. Never attempt to adjust or repair your denture yourself. You could damage it as well as your natural teeth.

###Periodic Examination
It is important to have your denture examined every six months at the same time as your regular examination. Your denture does not change shape, but your mouth is constantly changing. The ridges that support the denture shrink, causing the denture to become loose over time. Any remaining natural teeth also need to be checked. Never leave a partial denture out of your mouth for longer than overnight because your natural teeth are constantly drifting, and the partial denture may not fit properly. Proper fit and support are necessary for your comfort and to prevent injury to remaining teeth.
