Title: Accidental Tooth Loss

----

Text:

If you have an accident that results in a tooth being knocked out, root and all, here are some tips to possibly save the tooth:

* Find the tooth.
* Do not brush it off or "clean" it. You can lightly rinse it with water.
* Place the tooth in a glass of milk. If milk is not available, use water.
* Call your dentist immediately for further treatment.
